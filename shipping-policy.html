    <p>At AR Resin Art, we handle each order with care to ensure your custom artwork is safely delivered to you. Here’s what you need to know about our shipping policy:</p>

    <h2>Shipping Process</h2>
    <p>Once we receive your personal items (e.g., photos, rings, chains), we start working on your custom resin artwork. After completing your piece, we carefully pack it and ship it through a trusted courier service.</p>

    <h2>Shipping Costs</h2>
    <p>Shipping costs are calculated based on the size, weight, and destination of the finished product. These costs are added to your total service cost and will be charged at checkout.</p>

    <h2>Delivery Time</h2>
    <p>Delivery times can vary depending on your location. Typically, shipping takes between 7 to 14 business days after your custom piece has been completed.</p>

    <h2>Lost or Damaged Items</h2>
    <p>If your personal items are lost or damaged while being shipped to us, AR Resin Art is not responsible for the loss. If the resin artwork is damaged during shipping, please notify us within 7 days, and we’ll work to resolve the issue.</p>
