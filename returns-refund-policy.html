    <p>At AR Resin Art, we take great care to ensure that every custom resin artwork is securely packed and arrives in perfect condition. As of now, we have not encountered any instances where returns or refunds were necessary.</p>

    <h2>No Returns or Refunds</h2>
    <p>Due to the highly personalized nature of our resin artwork, we do not accept returns or offer refunds. Each piece is custom-made based on your unique specifications and personal items, making it impossible to resell or reuse.</p>

    <h2>Our Safe Packing Process</h2>
    <p>We carefully pack each resin art piece using high-quality packaging materials to prevent any damage during shipping. Our track record shows that our packaging process has been effective, with no reported returns or damages.</p>

    <h2>Exceptions</h2>
    <p>If, in the rare case, your artwork arrives damaged, please contact us within 7 days of receiving the item. We will assess the situation, and if necessary, either repair the piece or offer a partial refund, depending on the circumstances.</p>
